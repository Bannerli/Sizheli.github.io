**[The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery](https://sakana.ai/ai-scientist/)**
```
The AI scientist, the first comprehensive system for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling Foundation Models
such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform research independently.

We propose and run a fully AI-driven system for automated scientific discovery, applied to machine learning research.
The AI Scientist automates the entire research lifecycle, from generating novel research ideas, writing any necessary code, and executing experiments, to summarizing experimental results, visualizing them, and presenting its findings in a full scientific manuscript.
We also introduce an automated peer review process to evaluate generated papers, write feedback, and further improve results. It is capable of evaluating generated papers with near-human accuracy.
The automated scientific discovery process is repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion and add them to a growing archive of knowledge, thus imitating the human scientific community.
In this first demonstration, The AI Scientist conducts research in diverse subfields within machine learning research, discovering novel contributions in popular areas, such as diffusion models, transformers, and grokking.
